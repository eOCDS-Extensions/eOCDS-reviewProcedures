# ReviewProcedures

Extension to cover the legal actions which allow EOs to request the enforcement of public procurement regulations and their rights under those regulations in cases where CAs fail to comply with the legal framework for public procurement.

## Backgound

Detailed provisions relating to the types of remedy available are generally subject to local law. But generally speaking,  four types of remedies are available: 
- Interim measures
- Set aside of decisions 
- Annulment of a Concluded Contract
- Damages

### Types of remedies
#### Interim measures

Interim measures are provisional measures taken in relation to the contract notice and any contracting decision, including the contract award decision. The aim of interim measures is to prevent the creation of unalterable situations and to avoid the continuation of the contract award procedure without an economic operator that would otherwise have been able to participate and possibly be awarded the contract. These aims may only be achieved if the local legal system provides an effective, simple and speedy possibility of obtaining interim relief and if the competent review body is not reluctant to grant interim relief as a matter of principle.

The following interim measures can typically be requested:
- Suspension of the implementation of any decision taken by the contracting authority
- Suspension of the whole contract award procedure

#### Set aside of decisions

The application for the set-aside remedy cancels or renders ineffective a contracting decision taken unlawfully or otherwise, corrects an unlawful situation. The aim of set-aside is to correct proven irregularities. This aim is only achieved if the local legal system provides an effective possibility of canceling an unlawful specification or contracting decision and if the competent review body reviews the reasonableness of contracting decisions.

The following measures can typically be ordered:
- Removal of discriminatory technical, economic or financial specifications in the contract notice, tender documents or any other document relating to the contract award procedure;
- Annulment of an unlawful contracting decision
- Positive correction of any unlawful document or contracting decision, for example, an order of the contracting authority to amend or delete an unlawful clause in the tender documents or to reinstate an economic operator that had been unlawfully excluded.

#### Set aside of decisions

The annulment of an already concluded contract or a declaration that the contract is null and void by a third party to the contract is an available remedy, which applied at least if the contract is concluded during the standstill period. The possibility to annul a concluded contract is a crucial remedy since in jurisdictions without this possibility damages remain the only available remedy after this event.  

#### Damages

Damages are compensation paid to economic operators harmed by an infringement of the public procurement rules. The procedure and venue for bringing claims for damages depends on local legislation, which sets the filing rules, deadlines, requirements of proof, and extent of compensation (for example, the conditions under which tendering costs can be recovered). This remedy aims to compensate harmed economic operators. 

### Timeframe

Review proceedings may not be brought at any given point in time. Applicants for review normally have to initiate proceedings within certain time limits, counting from the moment in time when they learned about the alleged infringements of procurement law. 
 
#### Review period

This is a certian duration of time counting from the date of publication of Contract Notice and serves as a period to complain on published conditions: discriminatory technical, economic or financial specifications in the contract notice, tender documents or any other document relating to the contract award procedure.  

#### Standstill period

Contracting authorities are required to wait for a certain number of days between the contract award decision and the conclusion of the contract with the successful tenderer. This period allows rejected or not evaluated tenderers to challenge the contracting authoritys' decision not to award the contract to them, if they think that such a decision was unlawful, and therefore to prevent the contract from being concluded on the basis of an improper award decision.
